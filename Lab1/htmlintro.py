        Python is a fun and extremely easy-to-use programming language that has steadily gained
        in popularity over the last few years. Developed over ten years ago by Guido van Rossum,
        Python’s simple syntax and overall feel is largely derived from ABC, a teaching language that
        was developed in the 1980’s. However, Python was also created to solve real problems and it
        borrows a wide variety of features from programming languages such as C++, Java, Modula-3,
        and Scheme. Because of this, one of Python’s most remarkable features is its broad appeal to
        professional software developers, scientists, researchers, artists, and educators.</p>
